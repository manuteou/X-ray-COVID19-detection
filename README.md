X-ray COVID19 detection

This Project is from Kaggle, https://www.kaggle.com/tawsifurrahman/covid19-radiography-database

The aim of my project is to create a site on wich a radiologist can upload an X-ray, and have an help for diagnostic.
The model can predic if a patient is COVID positif, Viral Pneumonia positif or not infectited by this cases.

The accuracy on train and validation is 95%

The accuracy on a test set of 500 pictures is 85%
